1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:03,538
<i>Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...</i>

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:05,879
For us making it to senior year.

3
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:07,548
Not all of us made it.

4
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:08,882
Can you see, or not?
No.

5
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:11,785
The surgery didn't--
No, it didn't.

6
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,887
Garrett Reynolds, you're under arrest.
For what?

7
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,789
The murder of
Alison Dilaurentis.

8
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,891
<i>Is miss Rivers available?
How did you get my number?</i>

9
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:20,494
Hey. Everything okay

10
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:23,530
I need a lawyer, and your mom's
one of the best in the state.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,731
I'm not going to help you.

12
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,701
I think I remember
leaving your house,

13
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,836
and the next thing I know,
I'm here.

14
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,905
You guys, this is a set-up.
It's not "A."

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,975
Mona is drooling in her bed
at a nut hospital.

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,543
We don't know that for sure.

17
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,878
- I've been visiting her.
- What?!

18
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,814
"Mona played with dolls--
I play with body parts."

19
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:42,583
"Game on, bitches."

20
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:43,850
"A."

21
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,525
The author goes to great
lengths to establish Hedda Gabler

22
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,026
as a strong, proud woman,

23
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:57,030
someone who could never live with
the threat of being blackmailed.

24
00:00:57,065 --> 00:01:00,934
But Hedda was pushed
to take a desperate action.

25
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,704
And while she may have
seen it as brave,

26
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,706
we see it as tragic.

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,741
What might really be tragic

28
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,744
is if some of you
don't start taking some notes.

29
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:13,814
Sorry. Senior year is not
all about skipping classes

30
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:16,650
and dancing for the security
cameras at Walmart.

31
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,885
That's what
your weekends are for.

32
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:23,857
You might also want to research
some of his other plays

33
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,793
and see how they were
received at that time...

34
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:32,532
Emily, is everything all right?

35
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33,900
C-can I be excused?

36
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:42,776
Emily--

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,646
What's going on?
No, no. Just come on.

38
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,583
Em, what's the matter?
Talk to us.

39
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,720
What is that?

40
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,989
<i>Are those teeth?</i>

41
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:58,592
Please just get rid of it.

42
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:04,531
now we're gonna get
pieces of her delivered to us?

43
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,800
Guys, there probably aren't even human.
They're totally human!

44
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,536
How do you know? Because I
worked at a dentist's office.

45
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,572
For two days, answering phones. Yeah,
and there were teeth everywhere.

46
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:15,942
Even the friggin' bathroom key
was shaped like a cuspid.

47
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,719
Guys, real or not, this "A" is
working overtime to frame us.

48
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,788
First the call to Emily
from Spencer's phone,

49
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:30,557
then the cemetery photo, and now--
It's all my fault.

50
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:33,493
Em, stop. No. That whole
night is like a black hole.

51
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,529
I still can't figure out
how I got to Ali's grave.

52
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,564
We need to give this
to the police.

53
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:39,966
We can't. We already lied
to them about the lake house.

54
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,501
Yeah. That was
a huge mistake.

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,537
We keep digging ourselves
in deeper.

56
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,572
Burning those photos
was one thing--

57
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,541
These are teeth. Okay?

58
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,676
We should at least tell our parents.
Tell them what?

59
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,678
We have no idea
what this "A" knows.

60
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,881
Are you ready to explain every lie
we've ever told since Ali died?

61
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,616
You don't have to
protect me, okay?

62
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,884
I can take the blame
for all of this.

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,519
Emily, stop.

64
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,854
You're not in this by yourself.

65
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,522
But if you could
remember something else

66
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,658
from that black hole
besides an old car,

67
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,460
that'd be nice.
Hanna.

68
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:07,861
I'm just saying,
it'd be helpful.

69
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,663
Can we please
just get rid of that?

70
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:11,531
We can't toss this.
This is evidence.

71
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,633
I'll put it in my locker
until we figure out what to do.

72
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,635
Like your locker
is safe from "A"?

73
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,937
Just give it to me.
I'll put it in my purse--

74
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,807
Hanna.

75
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:22,542
I will get it.
No, wait!

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,544
You can't just dive in there.
These things have sensors.

77
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,580
Excuse me? You just have
to be really careful.

78
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:28,715
<i>Well, if you would like to. No.</i>

It wasn't like we were
gonna hand it over to the cops.

88
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,655
I wanted to. We could have
found out who sent it to us.

89
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:11,525
There were fingerprints on that necklace.
Yeah, mine.

90
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,693
Hanna, you have to go back to Radley.
What?

91
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,829
You need to make Mona talk.
Spencer's right.

92
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:17,597
Mona has never
been working alone,

93
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,566
and she's probably still
giving people orders.

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,801
Find out who else has seen her.

95
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,570
You guys just ripped me a new
one last week for visiting her.

96
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,772
Now you want me to
go back there with cupcakes?

97
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,742
If we want answers,
focusing on Garrett.

98
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:32,579
I will go back to Garrett,
if you will work on Mona.

99
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,881
Will you go today?
After school?

100
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,799
Has anyone spoken to her
since school started?

101
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,736
No. I still think
it's really shady

102
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:00,674
that she didn't get back from Music Camp
until the first day of school.

103
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,610
It's no shadier than Lucas
strolling around

104
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:05,545
on Saturday
at four in the morning.

105
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,547
Well, maybe that's
their witching house.

106
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:09,649
So now we think
they're definitely connected?

107
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,718
<i>Jenna and Lucas?</i>

108
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:15,455
<i>Em, you saw them talking to that Black Swan person
at the masquerade party.</i>

109
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,824
Mona could have an entire
outfield playing for her.

110
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,860
Hey, watch it.

111
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:23,530
Here you go, man. That's okay,
Jenna, don't worry about it.

112
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,867
Is it just me or is she blinder
than she was last year?

113
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,440
Hey. Still working on this?

114
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,709
Yeah, but I can fix it.

115
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,844
The school should be paying you.
A lot.

116
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,883
What's up?
You okay?

117
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,785
Um, I do have to
meet my mom after school.

118
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,822
She wants me to help
pick out an outfit

119
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,924
for this bank thingie,

120
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,760
so can we do dinner
tomorrow night instead?

121
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,632
Yeah.
Tomorrow night's fine.

122
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,834
Great. Well,
see you later, sweetie.

123
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:07,574
Your mom thinks
I'm a basket case.

124
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:08,842
My mom loves you, em.

125
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,677
She knows everything
that you've been through.

126
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:13,413
Can she spread the love
around the faculty lounge?

127
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:14,748
I have to take
four make-up exams

128
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,750
or they're gonna make me
repeat eleventh grade.

129
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,518
They can't hold you back.
Yes, they can.

130
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:19,786
I was absent all of April.

131
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,454
You're gonna get through this.

132
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,522
Maybe.

133
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,824
You just need
a study partner. A tutor.

134
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:28,595
Wait!
Why don't you just call Ezra?

135
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,498
If your first make-up test is an
English he could be your tutor.

136
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,867
awkward.
No, it's not.

137
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,570
Aria, I can't think of him
as "Mr. Fitz" anymore.

138
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,938
Okay? I've seen
his underwear drawer.

139
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,607
Those were his socks. Why would his
socks have a flap in the middle?

140
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,442
I'm texting you his number.
Aria, I don't--

141
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,678
He's not teaching right now,
and it's killing him.

142
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,480
You'd be helping
each other out.

143
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,686
Who is that?

144
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,657
Meredith.

145
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,493
<i>Wait. That's
your dad's Meredith?</i>

146
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,630
That's the skank you and Ali
caught lip-locking in the car?

147
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:06,499
If my mom sees her here...
What's she doing here?

148
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:09,869
Excuse me.

149
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:12,472
Are you looking for someone?

150
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,542
Hello, Aria. I forgot
you were still a student here.

151
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,644
Yeah, I am.
What are you doing here?

152
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,814
I'm applying for
an open teaching position.

153
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:23,817
Oh, don't worry, hon. I won't
put you down as a reference.

154
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:31,458
<i>I don't get it.</i>

155
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,460
Why would she want
to work at a school

156
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,762
where she's gonna bump into
my mother every single day?

157
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,864
And why should my mom
have to go through this?

158
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:39,833
She's been divorced
for, like, 20 minutes.

159
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:42,802
<i>Aria, breathe. Meredith
applied for the job,</i>

160
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,771
it doesn't mean she got it.

161
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:46,706
There's no reason
to tell your mom.

162
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:50,410
<i>Seriously, though, who is giving
that woman a reference--my dad?</i>

163
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:51,811
Ooh, yeah, I wouldn't
tell him either.

164
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,813
Why? You think he has
something to do with this?

165
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,715
I didn't say that,
I just think you're still

166
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,684
walking on bit of scorched
earth when it comes to us,

167
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:59,786
and if you put him on the defensive--
He's not in that place anymore.

168
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,489
Then why am I dropping you off
three blocks from your house?

169
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,658
Because he's still
in that place.

170
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,661
I hate this. I hate
having to sneak around

171
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,363
and avoid saying your name...

172
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:13,400
It's like
we're going backwards.

173
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,368
One battle at a time.

174
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:17,804
We just had a nice dinner--
with your mom.

175
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:21,641
<i>Okay? Let's celebrate
what is working.</i>

176
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,847
It's Emily. Has she
called you yet? No.

177
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,483
Why haven't you
called Ezra yet?

178
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,686
Call him now.
He's free.

179
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,854
Emily's gonna be calling you.
I might not answer.

180
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,524
Ezra, she's sinking.

181
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,658
Please?

182
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,644
So, um...

183
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:00,880
Did you talk to your mom?

184
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,684
No. I need you to give me
a better reason.

185
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,619
Other than being innocent?

186
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:09,389
Look, you said you knew
who dug up Ali's grave.

187
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,825
How do I know that the person
didn't just do that for you?

188
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,761
I didn't touch your friend Maya,
and I didn't kill Alison,

189
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,764
and guess what, what was snatched
from her grave that night

190
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,567
would have actually proved it.
How?

191
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,736
Is your mom
defending me or not?

192
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,574
Why would she or anyone else in this
town believe that you're innocent?

193
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:32,712
Spencer, somebody you know well
has you completely fooled.

194
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:38,485
People lie, but...
Medical records don't.

195
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,521
Whose medical records?

196
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,790
Who are you talking about?
Alison?

197
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,762
Jenna's?

198
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,797
Wait.

199
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,500
Are you talking about Jenna?

200
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,834
So it turns out ***

201
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:04,894
that frizzy-haired girl
who dates the quarterback.

202
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:07,579
You know, the one
who transferred from Ohio?

203
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,743
Well, Noel Kahn thinks
this dude is a genius

204
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,879
<i>because he can burp
the star-spangled banner.</i>

205
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,688
Have you...
Heard from Noel?

206
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,992
Does he ever come visit you?

207
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:38,604
Has anyone... Been to
visit you besides me?

208
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,812
You know what, Mona?
If I told the police

209
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,847
that you mowed me down
with your car,

210
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,751
you would not be here getting a slice of
peach pie every day to wash down your meds.

211
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,754
<i>You'd be sharing a jail cell with
someone calling you "Peach Pie"</i>

212
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,723
while you braid her back hair!

213
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,693
God, Mona, you owe me!

214
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,896
All right? You have made my
life a nightmare! You owe me!

215
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,902
What's going on?

216
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:13,539
<i>This visit's over.
Now.</i>

217
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,790
Hey there.

218
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,925
Hi.

219
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,828
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

220
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,497
No, I'm okay.
Thanks, Mr. Fitz.

221
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,666
You can call me Ezra.
No, I can't.

222
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,736
But I can try.

223
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,606
Have a seat.

224
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,979
So...Aria mentioned

225
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,649
you're taking the English
make-up exam this Thursday.

226
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,553
Yeah, and then chem and history
next week, and Spanish after that.

227
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:06,525
Great. Well, I'm glad we can start
with a language I actually speak...in.

228
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,661
But not always so well.
Did you like the novel?

229
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:13,532
Yeah, it was okay.
Ending was kind of sad.

230
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:19,538
Emily, um...

231
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,574
I'm so sorry about Maya.

232
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,777
We don't have to
talk about that.

233
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,545
No. I know.

234
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,681
But it's just, I--
I wanted you to know that.

235
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,787
I'm just...Sorry.

236
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,939
Your friend Mona deserves
to be drawn and quartered.

237
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,975
And given what she's done, I
understand you want to punish her.

238
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,945
That's not why I came here.

239
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,481
I just lost it.

240
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,715
I've done worse.

241
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,621
I once threw a bowl of soup
across the room

242
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,923
when visiting my dad.

243
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,492
In a place much like this.
Worse.

244
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,596
Your dad was in the nut house?
For years.

245
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,832
He checked out of my life
when I was ten,

246
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,502
traded our family room
for the chaos inside his head.

247
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,872
He made your friend down the
hall seem downright chatty.

248
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,707
She won't even apologize.

249
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,943
Then you have to
accept that, Hanna.

250
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,847
You've lost someone
whom you trusted.

251
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,651
<i>And then you might be grieving for the Mona you
didn't know as much as for the one you did.</i>

252
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,755
I'm getting really tired
of losing people.

253
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,559
And this is particularly hard because
Mona's right in front of you.

254
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,962
In clinical terms,
we call it "ambiguous loss."

255
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,966
What? There's been a death, but
it doesn't involve a body.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,902
Like when a soldier
goes missing,

257
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,739
or a relative
slips into dementia.

258
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,909
They're gone,
but yet, still here.

259
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,718
Here.

260
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,901
Where did Jenna go
when music camp ended?

261
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,503
Did your parents pick her up?

262
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,472
I have no idea. Why?

263
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,542
Well, that camp ended
on August 23rd.

264
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,644
I looked it up online.

265
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,480
Did she just stay up
in the Poconos?

266
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,715
Honestly, I don't know.

267
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,719
I was packing up my stuff
before she even went to camp.

268
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,956
Just eating breakfast there was weird.
How come?

269
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,859
My parents were treating Jenna
like one of her snow-globes.

270
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,761
After the surgery didn't work,

271
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,931
it was like they thought she'd crack
if they asked the wrong question.

272
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,638
Hey.
Hmm?

273
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,674
Come here.

274
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,816
You're a little tense.

275
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,752
Yeah.
I was born that way.

276
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,955
Maybe I can help.

277
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,728
<i>♪ ...just a lie</i>

278
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,665
<i>♪ but I found you out</i>

279
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,703

281
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,547
Spencer?

282
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,849
Yeah! In here!

283
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,652
Oh.

284
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,520
Hello, Toby.
Hey, Mrs. Hastings,

285
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,791
how's it goin'?
I've had better days.

286
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,462
Did your sister call? I've left
three messages for her.

287
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,464
Uh, no, is Melissa okay?

288
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:10,435
I don't think "okay" really applies
in her situation, does it?

289
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,437
Will you be joining us
for dinner, Toby?

290
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,607
Uh...Well, I was--

291
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,509
Sure.

292
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,913
<i>It was weird,
but we got past it.</i>

293
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,650
So you're calling him "Ezra,"
or "Mr. Fitz"?

294
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,818
Neither. It's a lot easier
not to call him anything.

295
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,787
Oh. That's what your
dad does, right, Aria?

296
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,624
Just about. This whole "don't ask,
don't tell" thing is not working.

297
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,660
I did that with my mom forever.

298
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,628
But she finally came around.

299
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,463
By the time
I brought Tamara over,

300
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,599
they were bonding
over arts and crafts.

301
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,969
I don't think my dad is gonna be
scrapbookin' with Ezra anytime soon.

302
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,639
What's that?

303
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,817
Is that yours?

304
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,488
What's going on?
Whose is that?

305
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,527
Do you want to save your
parents' marriage, or not?

306
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,429
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

307
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,898
If my dad said that Meredith's
history, I believe him.

308
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,702
Oh, grow up. They probably
do it on that couch. Daily.

309
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:21,573
Do you smell cheap perfume?

310
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,509
<i>Ali, there are other students
that come in here, okay?</i>

311
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,844
Yeah,
and how many of them

312
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,447
like to roll around
and sweat on his couch?

313
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,584
Is that someone coming?

314
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,728
Which student
does this belong to?

315
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,665
You found that in his couch?

316
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,633
Honey, I'm sure she's shed
a lot more than that.

317
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,670
Probably find her panties
in the mini-fridge.

318
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,812
Oh. So they have been
spending quality time together.

319
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,483
I hear break-up sex
is the best.

320
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,819
Why would he lie? He told
me that he ended it.

321
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,490
Maybe he did, sweetie.
But people make up.

322
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,592
They backslide.

323
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,631
Aria, if you really want
to get rid of this bitch,

324
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,801
you're gonna have to help daddy
figure out what she really is--

325
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,773
a vindictive,
homewrecking bunny-boiler.

326
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:32,644
Don't look now, but mere-death
is having a meltdown.

327
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,537
How come you never told us about that?
Why would I?

328
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,573
I felt like complete crap
by the time I got home,

329
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,708
and I made Alison promise
to never tell a soul.

330
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,812
So why is it in your locker? You've
been hiding it this whole time?

331
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,682
No. No. It's just that
you guys...

332
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:14,653
Don't you remember when Ali's mom
called us before her funeral

333
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:19,458
and she asked all of us if we
each wanted to put something....

334
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,826
A keepsake in her casket?

335
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,861
And that's what
you put in there?

336
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,734
<i>So real teeth or not, that was
definitely stolen from Ali's grave.</i>

337
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:41,380
So next, cite an example of
how the author uses symbolism.

338
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:44,557
Emily?

339
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,909
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

340
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:50,645
Wharton's use of symbolism?

341
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:54,682
The cat.

342
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,717
The broken dish.

343
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,756
Emily...

344
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,691
You know this material,

345
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:06,627
and you've been in
high-pressure situations before.

346
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,930
When you were swimming,
you thrived on them, right?

347
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:11,732
So how did you
prepare for a race?

348
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:15,703
What did you do minutes
before you jumped in that pool?

349
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:18,840
Um, I...
Listened to music.

350
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:21,976
Then that's what you'll do
before you take these exams.

351
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,980
Everything you need to know
is already in your head.

352
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:40,962
Aria? Is that you?

353
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:43,965
Jenna.

354
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,901
I thought I recognized
the ringtone.

355
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:49,704
I was going to
call you tonight.

356
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:52,540
Why?

357
00:20:52,574 --> 00:20:54,775
I lost my accompanist
for next week's assembly,

358
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,579
<i>and I thought of askingyou
to play with me.</i>

359
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,749
Oh. Uh...

360
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:03,651
I'm a little rusty.

361
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,520
Oh, it's an easy piece.

362
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:09,824
Just a couple of rehearsals
and we'd be good to go.

363
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:11,726
So you want to come over
tomorrow?

364
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,828
Gee, uh--uh--

365
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,730
I'd really love to, Jenna,

366
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:19,800
but I'm helping my dad with
this project he's doing, and--

367
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:23,671
He's actually waving at me from across
the street, so I really gotta go.

368
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:37,451
<i>She invited
you to that house?</i>

369
00:21:37,486 --> 00:21:41,822
<i>- What'd you say?
- I said no freakin' way. To myself.</i>

370
00:21:41,857 --> 00:21:44,592
But to her I just said
that I was busy.

371
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:48,462
Did you ever find a note? Are we
sure that earring came from "A"?

372
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:50,498
<i>I'd be a lot more sure</i>

373
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:52,533
if you could squeeze
something out of Mona.

374
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:54,835
<i>Please tell me that
you're going back there.</i>

375
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,672
<i>Are you? Uh, I don't know.
I'll call you back.</i>

376
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,841
Hey. Took long enough.

377
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,778
They messed up. Gave our
order to someone else.

378
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:05,680
Didn't you get my text?

379
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,849
Uh, no. I was
on the phone with Aria.

380
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:11,686
I'm starving.
Me too.

381
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,859
You got somewhere else
you need to be?

382
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:20,695
No. No.

383
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,597
Of course not.

384
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:30,638
Ask whoever that is
to call you back, please.

385
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:32,840
I-- I won't
answer it.

386
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:35,710
Everything okay?

387
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:41,549
No. Clearly it's not if my daughter's
making secret trips to the county jail.

388
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,488
There's still a lot of things
that I don't understand.

389
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:49,490
Yeah, me too, like why would
you have anything to do with

390
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,626
a man who's accused of murdering
two teenage girls?

391
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,461
Mom, Emily is really hurting,

392
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:55,563
and I just wanted some answers.

393
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:57,632
Did this happen to Maya
because she knew too much?

394
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,900
Did the D.A.'s office send you
there to ask that question?

395
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:03,537
I didn't think so.

396
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm guessing it'll be
answered at his trial.

397
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:10,411
Why are you talking to me like I'm a hostile witness?
Maya was my friend, too.

398
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,780
This is a dangerous man,
Spencer.

399
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:16,784
He wouldn't be locked up if there
weren't damaging evidence against him.

400
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:19,620
Don't you ever go there again.

401
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:23,591
So is rosewood safe now that one
dangerous man is locked up?

402
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,826
Because garret was already in
jail when Ali's grave was dug up.

403
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:28,729
If you're implying that he's got
helpful friends on the outside,

404
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,798
that's even more of
a reason not to see him.

405
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:32,867
People might think that's you.

406
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:35,836
<i>Don't you ever go there again.</i>

407
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:37,538
Am I clear?

408
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:49,483
I thought you were starved.

409
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:50,851
Guess I'm not.

410
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:56,590
Okay, where do you
need to be right now?

411
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,460
Hanna, we stopped lying to
each other a long time ago,

412
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:01,529
didn't we?

413
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:06,500
I was thinking of
visiting Mona at Radley.

414
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,541
Why now?
Just curious.

415
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,776
It's complicated.

416
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:18,846
No, it's more than complicated.
It is completely whacked.

417
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,881
Look, she was my best friend
in tenth grade. Yeah,

418
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,617
and she threw you a few
poisoned apples in the eleventh.

419
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:26,787
I don't expect you to understand, all right?
I know you hate her.

420
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:29,690
I feel sorry for her, okay? But not
enough to send her a get well card.

421
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:32,426
- Caleb-- - I don't care if she spends the
rest of her life in a paper gown

422
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:35,496
making ash trays and pooping
in a stall without a door

423
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,499
as long as she can't get
anywhere near you, or hurt you--

424
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:41,569
<i>It hurt me to
see her like this, okay?</i>

425
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:43,704
I'm having an ambiguous loss.

426
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:45,773
You're what?

427
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:48,642
That's what it's called. Someone
dies but they're still here.

428
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:50,778
Where did you pick that up?

429
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,581
I googled it, okay?

430
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:56,784
I'm not gonna have this fight.

431
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:05,826
Fine.
I'll go with you.

432
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,429
What?
To Radley.

433
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:10,364
I'll drive you there.

434
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:13,401
By the time we get there
visiting hours will be over.

435
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:15,736
Then we'll go tomorrow.

436
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:21,609
Why would you do that?

437
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,811
Because I love you.

438
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:27,848
And I don't want us
sneaking around each other.

439
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,810
Dad?

440
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,435
Can I talk to you?

441
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,132
Yeah. What's wrong?

442
00:26:28,235 --> 00:26:31,237
Will you sit down? I--
I need to tell you something.

443
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,709
Um...

444
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,018
I know that your office was
trashed a couple years ago.

445
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:51,023
And I know that
I'm not supposed to know that

446
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:53,826
because you thought that
it was Meredith who did it.

447
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:02,235
But it wasn't her, it was me.

448
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:09,208
Why are you
telling me this now?

449
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:15,781
Did seeing Meredith yesterday
bring this on?

450
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:21,754
I guess. Maybe.

451
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:25,191
Do you have any idea how close
I came to calling the police?

452
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:28,861
<i>I thought she wanted to hurt my family.
She already had.</i>

453
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:33,232
So I did it.

454
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:37,069
I said a lot of harsh things
to her at the time.

455
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:41,974
And now you're telling me that I
accused her of something that...

456
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,943
You did.

457
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,928
We both owe her an apology.

458
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:04,196
And I'm not doing that for you.

459
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:15,141
<i>♪ ...yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

460
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:20,079
<i>♪ jump in,
floating like a feather-- ♪</i>

461
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:23,783
You ready?

462
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:28,821
Okay, guys, you have 45 minutes.

463
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:31,924
I'll give you a five-minute warning
before I collect the tests.

464
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,059
Good luck.

465
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:53,245
So...
This won't be long.

466
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,816
If you need me,
I'll be right here, okay?

467
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,097
Hey, Mona.

468
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:15,801
I'm back.

469
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:24,043
I didn't come here
to throw any more chairs.

470
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:26,946
I just...

471
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,148
Wanted to return the favor.

472
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:41,894
I brought the good stuff.

473
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:44,797
<i>How did you
get your hands on these?</i>

474
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:48,034
Nobody was home. I found them
in Jenna's bathroom.

475
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,903
So what are they?
They're eye drops?

476
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:53,139
The doctor prescribed
the first bottle to Jenna

477
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:56,208
last spring after the surgery.
So?

478
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,045
Thank you.
Thanks.

479
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,179
You're welcome.

480
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:07,119
Check out the expiration date
on the other bottle.

481
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:12,825
If the surgery didn't work, why is she
still renewing that prescription?

482
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:16,162
<i>Wait. What are you saying?
You think Jenna can see?</i>

483
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:50,062
Emily?

484
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:51,263
Are you okay?

485
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:00,039
Five minutes, guys.

486
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:20,292
Okay, time is up.

487
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:30,269
Emily...
It's not a take-home test.

488
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:32,905
Oh, right.
Sorry.

489
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:36,108
Did you need more time?
No, I'm done.

490
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:37,810
Emily, wait.

491
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:39,278
Did you study for this?

492
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:41,213
Yeah, I did. But I--

493
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:43,883
I did the best I could.
I really have to go.

494
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,967
Hello.

495
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:05,037
Hi.

496
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:06,972
Do you want to sit?

497
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,145
I'd...really rather not
do this here, if that's okay.

498
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,781
Well, here is where we are.

499
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:16,916
Sit.

500
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,026
Look, I-- I know that
this is ancient history,

501
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,130
but I just needed
to clarify something.

502
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:36,869
After I found out about you and
my dad, I was really upset.

503
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,938
And I broke into his office--

504
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:41,106
You don't have to recount
all the gory details.

505
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:44,977
I spoke to your father
this morning.

506
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:49,248
I remember his threats on my
voicemail like it was yesterday.

507
00:32:49,282 --> 00:32:51,283
Right.

508
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:57,022
Well, I'm sorry.

509
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:59,024
Thank you.

510
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,128
Maybe I'll hear that from
your father tomorrow, too.

511
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:06,232
You're seeing him?
We made lunch plans.

512
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:09,235
And I guess I have you
to thank for that.

513
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:16,075
Is there something else
you want to say?

514
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:17,843
Yeah.

515
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:23,916
I didn't go to his office with the
intention of stealing anything,

516
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,019
I just took the earrings because--
Wait.

517
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,321
Go back. Earrings?

518
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,830
I don't have the other one, but as soon as
I find it I'll make sure that you get it.

519
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:44,937
What made you think
this belonged to me?

520
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,072
That's not my earring.

521
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:02,265
Can I help you?

522
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:05,134
Yeah, I'm just here
to visit Garrett Reynolds.

523
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,104
He's meeting with his lawyer.
It could be a while.

524
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:09,382
Oh. May I wait?

525
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:12,108
Suit yourself.
Thank you.

526
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:32,128
Can you give me a list of all
previous visitors, please?

527
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,066
Thanks.

528
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,237
No, no, no. I want something
compiled for the last five months.

529
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:45,207
I'll need a little
time to put that together.

530
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:47,276
Okay. Tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow works.

531
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,312
Okay, thanks.

532
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,368
Pardon me.
You're with Hanna?

533
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:17,173
I'm Dr. Kingston.
Hanna knows me as wren.

534
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:20,009
And you are?

535
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:21,277
Caleb.

536
00:35:21,311 --> 00:35:23,045
Her boyfriend.

537
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,016
Very good. So you decided
to join her this time.

538
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,384
Yeah.

539
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,987
Yeah, Hanna pretty much does
whatever she wants,

540
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,155
so I figured
I would get onboard.

541
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,024
Indeed. Well,
from what I've gathered,

542
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:37,259
coming here has been a great
source of conflict for her.

543
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:40,029
She's spoken to you about this?

544
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,999
She has. We talked about
patience and compassion.

545
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,368
It seems like the other day was a
bit of a turning point for her.

546
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:47,370
She's just starting to
come to terms with

547
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:50,439
all the anger that's tied
to ambiguous loss.

548
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:57,079
Well, then, best press on.

549
00:35:57,114 --> 00:36:00,049
But please give Hanna
my best. Nice meeting you.

550
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,051
Yeah. Same here.

551
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:20,936
What was my mother doing here?

552
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,073
Sorry. I can't talk.

553
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,208
My new attorney
made me promise.

554
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:29,078
What-- what are you saying?

555
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,013
Is my mother your lawyer now?

556
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,217
No. There's--
there's no way--

557
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:38,020
I never even asked her
to help you.

558
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:41,057
I couldn't, she still
thinks you're guilty.

559
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:42,324
What did you say that
made her change her mind?

560
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,193
I gotta go.
Wait.

561
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:47,096
- What about Jenna, though?
Could you at least tell me-- - I'm done.

562
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:49,892
Okay,
so the lighting in here sucks.

563
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:52,228
But at least you're starting to
look like someone I recognize.

564
00:37:59,202 --> 00:38:01,237
Look, Mona,

565
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:04,073
I didn't come here
to play beauty shop.

566
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:09,111
I came here because I know there
is a person still in there.

567
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:12,081
I know you've been hurt,
but so have I.

568
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,016
And I still am.

569
00:38:18,822 --> 00:38:21,924
Trust me, you're not the first
person to hurt me, Mona.

570
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:25,995
And you're certainly
not the last.

571
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:32,868
You're getting them
again, aren't you?

572
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:34,170
The texts.

573
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:41,143
Hey, Hanna. The nurse said
that visiting hours are over.

574
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:44,046
Um, yeah, can you, uh,
can you give me a minute?

575
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,849
Just tell the nurse
that I have to pack up.

576
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,855
Mona, what texts
are you talking about?

577
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,061
What texts are you
talking about?

578
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:03,032
Mona.

579
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,235
Hanna, come on.

580
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,906
We're not done with this.

581
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:12,208
Okay? Do you hear me?

582
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:18,948
I'm coming back, Mona.

583
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:55,497
Sorry to disturb you.
Do you have a minute?

584
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:59,839
Sure. But if
this is about Aria--

585
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:02,888
It's Emily.
What about her?

586
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:06,024
Well, I saw her after
the makeup exam yesterday,

587
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:09,728
and she was...distraught.
She thought she did poorly.

588
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:10,962
I don't know
if Aria's motioned it,

589
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:13,031
but I've been helping her
prep for these exams, and--

590
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:14,866
What is your question?

591
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:18,670
I just wanted to know
how she did.

592
00:40:19,972 --> 00:40:22,073
She did...fine.

593
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:26,645
There's a lot riding
on this for her.

594
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,846
Now, maybe if she could
take it again--

595
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,916
There's no need for her
to take it again, Ezra.

596
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,653
I understand
what she's gone through.

597
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:37,656
Emily did very well.

598
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,792
We're all rooting
for her to succeed.

599
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,063
Great.

600
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:47,599
<i>That's all she said?</i>

601
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:49,801
<i>Isn't that enough?
No. That is not enough.</i>

602
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:51,937
You have to go back
to Radley, Han. Alone.

603
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:55,006
It's not so easy. Caleb is all over me.
I don't need to know that.

604
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,776
Well, Caleb's not finding
dug-up jewelry in his locker.

605
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,845
Whose earring did Ali find in my dad's couch?
One question at a time.

606
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,682
You're not gonna ask your mom why
she's suddenly defending Garrett?

607
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:04,983
I mean, seriously, Spencer,
what is that?

608
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:07,752
He probably told her
it's time to lock Jenna up.

609
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:10,722
She was driving that night,
guys. I remembered. Clearly.

610
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:12,724
We believe you, okay?

611
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:16,661
But honestly, I don't think that you
remember anything clearly from that night.

612
00:41:16,696 --> 00:41:18,863
When we picked you up
you kept calling me "Arlene."

613
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:21,967
Guys, she can see. She's
probably on Mona's payroll.

614
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,836
Mona does not have any cash. They
won't even let her have floss.

615
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:28,773
Okay, let's just
do this at lunch.

616
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:30,709
I can't be late again.

617
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:33,912
I'll be right back.

618
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:36,815
I just need to rinse
my water bottle.

619
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:39,618
Jenna's coming in here.
Where's the earring?

620
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:42,721
What? Give me the earring.
I have an idea.

621
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:44,990
What are we doing?
Do I get to slap her again?

622
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,591
No!

623
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:50,829
Okay, get in the stalls.
Go! Go!

624
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:50,955
<i>I knew it. That is it. I'm going
for way more than a slap.</i>

625
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,558
Hanna, stop.
Stop why?!

626
00:42:53,592 --> 00:42:56,695
Don't look at me. I'm ready to hang a sign--
"Bitch can see."

627
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:58,730
She doesn't know that we know.
She will in a minute.

628
00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:01,566
<i>No. We don't let her know
that we know. Not yet.</i>

629
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,635
<i>We can use this...</i>

630
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:05,570
And we will.

631
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:20,618
This is all we got.

632
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:22,687
Season hasn't
really started yet.

633
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,957
We usually don't get
our shipment till next month.

634
00:43:29,628 --> 00:43:31,763
You want all these hoodies too?

635
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:32,907
You got it.

636
00:43:36,642 --> 00:43:37,592
So...

637
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:40,604
You buy all these for a team?

638
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:52,359
